# Lab 4 - Web Development

## Overview
In Lab 4 of Web Development, we applied HTML and JavaScript effectively to develop interactive and functional web pages. This lab focused on demonstrating a thorough understanding of syntax, structure, event handling, and DOM manipulation to enhance the user experience. The tasks included:

1. **Content Manipulation** - Using JavaScript to dynamically change the text content of HTML elements, showcasing DOM manipulation.
2. **Input Validation** - Creating JavaScript functions to validate user input and display alerts based on specific conditions (e.g., checking if the input is a number and whether it is higher or lower than a given value). This demonstrated skills in event handling and conditional statements.
3. **Loops and Iteration** - Implementing a `for` loop in JavaScript to generate and display a sequence of numbers with corresponding text, reinforcing the use of loops in web development.

Throughout this lab, we focused on applying HTML tags and JavaScript functions to meet specific requirements, emphasizing the effective use of event handling, loops, and DOM manipulation. The goal was to build visually appealing and responsive web pages that provide an enhanced user experience.
